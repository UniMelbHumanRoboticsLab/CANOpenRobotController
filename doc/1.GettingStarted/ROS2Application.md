# ROS2 Application - Instructions

Minimal instructions to compile and run a CORC application as a ROS2 node able to publish the robot state.

These instructons have been tested with ROS2 Humble and ROS2 Jazzy and assumes you have an Ubuntu system with one of those versions installed (it may work with other ROS2 versions but this has not been tested). See [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html) for ROS2 installation instructions.
Testing the application also assumes you have an ExoMotus X2 Exoskeleton.


> Note : these instructions are for ROS2. See [here](AdvancedSimulationAndHardwareTesting.md) for a ROS1 example.
> Note : specific, detailed instructions for running ROS2 with the Armmotus EMU (as well as Python packages) are available [here](https://github.com/UniMelbHumanRoboticsLab/FourierEMU-CORC-ROS2).

## Compilation


```bash
$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

In CORC root directory, rename ros2 package configuration file
```bash
$ mv package.ros2.xml package.xml
```


Edit the CMAKEFileList.txt to select a ROS2 state machine:

```
...
...
#include(src/apps/X2DemoMachine/app.cmake)
include(src/apps/X2ROS2DemoMachine/app.cmake)
#include(src/apps/LoggingDevice/app.cmake)
#include(../myStateMachineApp/app.cmake) ## example only, need to be defined

# Comment to use actual hardware, uncomment for a nor robot (virtual) app
set(NO_ROBOT OFF)

...
...
```

In the state machine folder, open the `app.cmake` and ensure it is configured to use ROS2:
```
################################## USER FLAGS ##################################

## Which platform (robot) is the state machine using?
## this is the correspondig folder name in src/hardware/platform to use
set(PLATFORM X2)

## Compile for ROS 2
set(ROS 2)

################################################################################
...

```


From the **CANOpenController parent folder**, compile the package:
```bash
$ colcon build
$ source install/setup.bash
```


## Run the node 
```bash
$ ros2 run CORC X2ROS2DemoMachine_APP
```

Here CORC is the package name and the CORC app name is the executable name.

See the content of the `src/apps/X2ROS2DemoMachine` folder to see how to interact with ROS2 from within CORC.
